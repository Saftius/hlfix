hlfix is a tool that converts Worldcraft/VHE format files (.rmf) to standard .map files. In the process, it performs a number of geometric operations to fix common problems with brush geometry. hlfix is far more sophisticated than VHE's built-in map export feature. The purpose of this tool is to give map designers much greater flexibility in the type of geometry they use to build their maps. (Source: [hlfix website] (http://extension.ws/hlfix/))
